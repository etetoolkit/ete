# Overview

ETE (Environment for Tree Exploration) is a toolkit that assists in
the automated manipulation, analysis and visualization of trees. It is
mainly written in Python, and includes many extra functionalities for
phylogenetic trees.

Its main features include:

- Read and write support for trees in Newick format
- Multiple functions for traversing, searching and manipulating tree topologies and node annotations
- Integration with NCBI Taxonomic database
- Integration with GTDB database
- Programmatic visualization framework
- Visualization of huge trees based on adaptive zooming
- Comparing trees
- Phylogenetic functions
  - orthology detection
  - phylogenetic distance
- Command line tools
  - phylogenetic reconstruction protocols
  - tree comparison
  - tree diff

The official website of ETE is http://etetoolkit.org. You can find
downloading instructions and further documentation there.

News and announcements are usually posted on twitter:

# Installation

## Quick way

```sh
pip install https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete/archive/ete4.zip
```


## For local development

To install ETE in a local directory to help with the development, you can:

- Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete.git`)
- Install dependecies
  - If you are using [conda](https://conda.io/):
  `conda install -c conda-forge cython bottle brotli numpy pyqt`
  - Otherwise, you can install them with `pip install <dependencies>`
- Build and install ete4 from the repository's root directory: `pip install -e .`

## Optional dependencies

If you want to use the `treeview` module (which depends on
[PyQt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/)), you can
add `[treeview]` to the pip installation. For example:

```sh
pip install -e .[treeview]
```


# Exploring a tree

To simply load a tree and start exploring it interactively, you can
start a python session and write:

```py
from ete4 import Tree

t = Tree(open(file_with_newick))

t.explore()
```

It will open a browser window with an interface to explore the tree.

# Getting support

Rather than sending direct support-related emails to the developers,
it is better to keep the communication public.

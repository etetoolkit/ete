Overview
-----------
ETE (Environment for Tree Exploration is a Python programming
toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation, analysis and
visualization of phylogenetic trees. Clustering trees or any
other tree-like data structure are also supported. 

ETE is currently developed as a tool for researchers working in phylogenetics
and genomics. ETE provides specialized tools to reconstruct, compare and visualize
phylogenetic trees. If you use ETE for a published work, please cite:

Getting Support
------------------

- For any type of question on how to use ETE in bioinformatics, the BioStars
  community (http://biostars.org) provides an excellent help desk. ETE
  developers contribute there with answers, but will also get feedback from
  other users. It is recommended to tag your questions with the "etetoolkit"
  label.

- For technical problems or more ETE specific questions, you can also use the
  official ETE mailing list at https://groups.google.com/d/forum/etetoolkit. To
  avoid spam, messages from new users are moderated. Expect some delay until
  your first message and account is validated.

  *As this mailing list is regularly checked for pending messages by the ETE developers,
  messages are more likely to be addressed than direct support questions sent to
  the developers' emails.*

- Bug reports and feature requests are usually discussed at
  https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete/issues

- For any other inquire, preferably non-support questions, please contact
  *huerta /at/ embl.de*

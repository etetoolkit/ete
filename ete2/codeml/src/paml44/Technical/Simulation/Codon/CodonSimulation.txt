(A) evolver: program for simulating codon sequences

This document explains how to compile evolver to simulate codon
sequences under the branch (Yang 1998), site (Nielsen & Yang 1998;
Yang et al. 2000), and branch-site models (Yang & Nielsen 2002; Yang
et al. 2005).  By default, option 6 of evolver simulates codon
sequences under the codon model assuming the same omega (dN/dS) ratio
for all sites and lineages (model M0).  The folder also includes a
program called PositiveSites, which can be used to compare evolver and
codeml outputs to calculate performance measurements of the inference
under the site or branch-site models.

The included .exe files are MS Windows executables.  If you use
unix/linux/osx, you should delete the .exe files, and compile the
programs yourself.  cd to the paml/src/ folder.  Then type one of the 
following commands to compile.  If you want, you can add some other 
compiler switches specific to your OS/compiler.

evolverNSbranches:
     cc -O2 -DCodonNSbranches    -o evolverNSbranches evolver.c tools.c -lm

evolverNSsites:
     cc -O2 -DCodonNSsites       -o evolverNSsites evolver.c tools.c -lm

evolverNSbranchsites:
     cl -O2 -DCodonNSbranchsites -o evolverNSbranchsites evolver.c tools.c -lm


(A1) evolverNSbranches takes input from MCcodonNSbranches.dat and simulate
codon sequences with different omega ratios (dN/dS) for different
branches on the tree, that is, under the model of Yang (1998).  Check
that file for details, a copy of which is included in this folder.
Note that you specify the branch lengths in the tree using the symbol
":", as in other programs, and you specify the omega ratio for the
branch using the symbol "#", a notation not used by other programs.

(A2) evolverNSsites takes input from MCcodonNSsites.dat and simulates codon
sequences with a few classes of sites with different omega ratios
(dN/dS).  This is the discrete (M3) model of Yang et al. (2000).  You
can of course use this format to simulate other models as well,
because they are its special cases.  For example, model M2a
(PositiveSelecion) uses three site classes with omega < 1, = 1, and >
1, so you can use a omega = 1 in the data file.  Check the file for
details, a copy of which is included in this folder.

Note that the branch length under a codon model is defined as the
expected number of nucleotide substitutions per codon.  Under NSsites
models, the silent rate is assumed to be constant along the sequence,
and only the replacement rates are assumed to vary.  The branch length
is then defined as the expected number of nucleotide substitutions per
codon, averaged over the site classes.

(A3) evolverNSbranchsites takes input from MCcodonNSbranchsites.dat and
simulates codon sequences under variations of the branch-site models
(Yang & Nielsen 2002).  Look at the file MCcodonNSbranchsites.dat and
the documentation.  In this case, there are several site classes, and
in each site class, the different branches on the tree have different
omega ratios.  For example, the following might be part of the
specification in MCcodonNSbranchsites.dat for simulating 4 site
partitions (classes) on a tree of five species: A - E.  This specifies
the tree topology and branch lengths, 4 site classes in the
proportions 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.  Next the omega values for
branches are specified for each of the four site partitions.  Viewed
another way, each branch has a few site partitions with the same
silent rate but variable replacement rates and thus omega's.  The
branch length, say 0.1 for the branch leading to species A, is the
expected number of nucleotide substitutions per codon, averaged over
the site classes.

((A #0.2, B #0.0) #2.0, C #0.0, D #0.8);  * omega for partition 4
==================================================================

Note that evolverNSbranchsites will read the same tree topology 5
times to simulate 4 site partitions, the first time to read the branch
lengths and four more times to read the omega values for branches in
each site partition.  Do not include omega values in the first tree
and do not include branch lengths in the second to last trees.  This
set up allows you to simulate under much more general models than the
branch-site model A implemented in paml/codeml (see Yang & Nielsen
2002; Yang et al. 2005).

evolverNSbranchsites samples sites from the site partitoins at random,
so that the number of sites in each partition varies among replicate
data sets.  This is assumed by the branch-site models of Yang and
Nielsen (2002).  In the simulations of Zhang (2004) and Zhang, Nielsen
& Yang (2005), the number of sites in each partition is fixed.  These
authors also considered various violations of the branch-site models
of Yang and Nielsen (2002).


(B) PositiveSites: Program for summarizing simulation results
concerning inference of sites under positive selection under site
and branch-site models.

When you use evolverNSsites (see above) to simulate data sets, the
program will generate a file called siterates.txt, listing the sites
that have omega > 1 and are thus truly under positive selection in
each simulated data set.  When the data sets are analyzed using
codeml, codeml will print results in a file called mlc (and in rst),
which may include a list of sites inferred to be under positive
selection with calculated empirical Bayes posterior probabilities.
PositiveSites compares siterates.txt and mlc to calculate a few
measures of performance of the codeml analysis.  This is the kind of
analyses used in the simulation studies of Anisimova et al. (2002) and
Wong et al. (2004).

Currently codeml uses two procedures to calculate the posterior
probabilities: the Naive Empirical Bayes (NEB: Nielsen & Yang 1998; Yang et
al. 2000) and Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB: Yang, Wong, Nielsen
2005).  NEB uses maximum likelihood estimates of parameters
without accounting for their errors, while BEB uses a prior to correct
for uncertainties in the parameter estimates.  codeml prints out the
NEB results, followed by the BEB results in both mlc and rst, while
PositiveSites processes mlc only.  The included windows executables
PositiveSitesNEB and PositiveSitesBEB are for processing the NEB and
BEB results, respectively.  To compile for unix, use the following
command to compile the included source file.

   cc -O2 -DNEB        -o PositiveSitesNEB PositiveSites.c -lm
   cc -O2 -DBEB        -o PositiveSitesBEB PositiveSites.c -lm
   cc -O2 -DBranchSite -o PositiveSitesBS  PositiveSites.c -lm

The program relies on a unique string in the codeml output mlc to
identify results for each simulated replicate.  NEB relies on the
string "Naive Empirical".  BEB relies on the string "Bayes Empirical".
The source file PositiveSites.c is rather short so you can check the
source file.

PositiveSitesNEB, PositiveSitesBEB, and PositiveSitesBS are all
supposed to work with codeml in paml 3.14 or later.  (Note that BEB was not
implemented prior to version 3.14.)  

The program should be run as follows:

   PositiveSitesBEB <#sites> <#repl>
   PositiveSitesBEB <#sites> <#repl> <Evolverf> <Codemlf>
   PositiveSitesBS  <#sites> <#repl> <Evolverf> <Codemlf> <positive site classes>



The whole analysis should be run in the following order: simulate data sets, analyze 
datasets, and summarize the results.  

	evolverNSsites
	codeml
	PositiveSitesNEB 100 500

The last line above tells PositiveSites the number of codons in the sequence (100) 
and the number of simulated replicates on the command line.


Now about the measurements.  PositiveSites calculates the accuracy,
power, and false positive rate of codeml inference of positive
selection sites.  The measures are defined as follows (Anisimova et
al. 2002; Wong et al. 2004).

                             codeml inference
                              +        -         Total
        evolver    +          N++      N+-       N+.
                   -          N-+      N--       N-.
                   Total      N.+      N.-       N

   Accuracy      = N++/N.+
   Power         = N++/N+.
   FalsePositive = N-+/N-.

The program collects N++ (NmatchB & NmatchC), N+. (NEvolver), and N.+
(NCodemlB & NcodemlC), and then calculates the three measures as
above.  Note that codeml inference depends on a cutoff P, hence the B
(for binned) and C (for cumulative) difference.  All proportions are
calculated as the ratio of averages, taking the ratio after counting
sites over replicate data sets.  Output is on the screen.  There are
more descriptions of those measures in Yang, Wong & Nielsen
(submitted).



(C) Appensix: Testing the NEB algorithm.  This may not interest you
anymore since it is about NEB, which is now superceded by the BEB.  It
is not deleted yet as I spent time writing it and as it does explain
what the posterior probabilities calculated by the NEB and BEB
procedures mean.  You can confirm the calculation of codeml and also
the simulation program by fixing parameters at their true values
(values used in the simulation).  For example, you can use a small
tree, simulated 100 codons in sequence and 500 datasets, using fixed
parameters for the w distribution (say under model 2A).  Then analyze
the data using codeml but with all parameters including branch
lengths, kappa, and parameters in the w distribution fixed at their
true values.  You can do this by using in.codeml.  See the paml
Documentation about how to set this up.  Then when codeml says a site
is under positive selection with probability 0.9, that site is under
positive selection with probability 0.9.  The following is a sample
output from PositiveSitesNEB in one such simulation.  Consider the
second line of output.  1645 sites were listed by codeml as being
under positive selection with posterior probability in the bin
0.55-0.60.  Among them, 55.1% of them are truly under positive
selection (on the evolver list).  This proportion is in the column
"AccuracyBin", accuracy binned.  If both evolver and codeml are
correct, we should expect this proportion to be between 0.55 and 0.60,
and in this case the match seems to be good enough.  There are 65422
sites with posterior probability exceeding 0.55 according to codeml,
and 93.2% of them are truly under positive selection.  This proportion
is in the column "AccuracyCum", accuracy accumulated.  There is no
theory to predict what this proportion should equal to except that it
should exceed 0.55.  The last column "Power" is the power of the
codeml analysis.  At the 55% cutoff, 88.2% of the 69098 sites truly
under positive selection were picked up by codeml.  Another measure,
used by Wong et al. (2004), is the false positive rate.  This is
defined as the number of sites falsely identified to be under posiitve
selection by codeml among all sites not under positive selection.

 0.80 - 0.85:   0.821 ( 2466)    >0.80:   0.974 (56470)   0.796 (69098)
 0.85 - 0.90:   0.876 ( 3057)    >0.85:   0.981 (54004)   0.766 (69098)
 0.90 - 0.95:   0.925 ( 4785)    >0.90:   0.987 (50947)   0.728 (69098)
 0.95 - 0.99:   0.975 (10202)    >0.95:   0.993 (46162)   0.664 (69098)
 0.99 - 1.00:   0.998 (35960)    >0.99:   0.998 (35960)   0.520 (69098)

A test like this only confirms that the programs are likely to be
correctly coded.  It does not tell much about the performance of the
codeml analysis of real data sets.  In real data analysis, the model
used by codeml might be wrong and the true values of parameters
are unknown.

A similar test can be conducted to confirm the BEB calculation.  In
this case the data should be simulated by drawing parameter values
(such as the proportions and omega ratios) from the prior.  Yang,
Wong, Nielsen (2005: fig. 2) inlcuded an example of this test, which
is also used to illustrate the Bayesian and frequentist measures of
performance.
